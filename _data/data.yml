career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I hold a bachelor's degree in Astronomy from the Federal University of Rio 
      de Janeiro and completed my Ph.D. in Astronomy, at the Valongo Observatory 
      (OV/UFRJ), with a CAPES scholarship. The main focus of my doctoral thesis 
      was stellar dating through Galactic kinematics, involving work with 
      theoretical evolutionary models and Bayesian isochronal dating. I am 
      currently working on the S-PLUS survey, where I am responsible for the 
      photometric calibration and the organization of the Main Survey Data 
      Releases. As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of São Paulo, 
      supported by a FAPESP fellowship, my main areas of research are the 
      Galactic structure and the exploration and characterization of 
      low-metallicity stars. I also have international academic experience as a 
      year-long Research Visitor at the NOIRLab institute, supported by a FAPESP 
      research internship abroad (BEPE).
    summary-more:
      During my postdoctoral fellowship, I was selected as a
      Collaborating Professor under the "USP's Talent Attraction and Retention
      Program", where I instructed the "Introduction to Astronomy" course for
      four semesters. Furthermore, I completed two teaching internships during
      my Ph.D. and served as a student tutor for three semesters during my
      undergraduate years. 
      <br><br>
      I also have experience in the field of science
      outreach, as one of the founders of the Astrotubers YouTube channel, a
      contributor to the Ad Astra program, and an organizer of the "Astronomia
      ao Meio Dia" lecture series. Additionaly, for a year during my Ph.D., 
      I held the position of Graduate Student's representative.

        details: |
          Supported by the Post-doctorate research internship abroad (BEPE) of 
          FAPESP (São Paulo Research Funding Agency), I spent the year of 2022
          working as a visiting researcher at the NOIRLab institute, in Tucson,
          Arizona. During my time there, I worked on projects related to 
          metal-poor stars. In particular, we used photometric criteria to 
          select metal-poor stars in S-PLUS and studied them in greater details 
          using data from spectroscopic follow-ups using the telescopes Blanco, 
          Gemini and Magellan-Clay. This collaboration is still ongoing even
          now that I'm back in Brazil.
