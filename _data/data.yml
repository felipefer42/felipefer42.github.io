career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I hold a bachelor's degree in Astronomy from the Federal University of Rio 
      de Janeiro and completed my Ph.D. in Astronomy, at the Valongo Observatory 
      (OV/UFRJ), with a CAPES scholarship. The main focus of my doctoral thesis 
      was stellar dating through Galactic kinematics, involving work with 
      theoretical evolutionary models and Bayesian isochronal dating. I am 
      currently working on the S-PLUS survey, where I am responsible for the 
      photometric calibration and the organization of the Main Survey Data 
      Releases. As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of São Paulo, 
      supported by a FAPESP fellowship, my main areas of research are the 
      Galactic structure and the exploration and characterization of 
      low-metallicity stars. I also have international academic experience as a 
      year-long Research Visitor at the NOIRLab institute, supported by a FAPESP 
      research internship abroad (BEPE).
    summary-more:
      <br>
      During my postdoctoral fellowship, I was selected as a
      Collaborating Professor under the "USP's Talent Attraction and Retention
      Program", where I instructed the "Introduction to Astronomy" course for
      four semesters. Furthermore, I completed two teaching internships during
      my Ph.D. and served as a student tutor for three semesters during my
      undergraduate years. 
      <br><br>
      I also have experience in the field of science
      outreach, as one of the founders of the Astrotubers YouTube channel, a
      contributor to the Ad Astra program, and an organizer of the "Astronomia
      ao Meio Dia" lecture series. Additionaly, for a year during my Ph.D., 
      I held the position of Graduate Student's representative.

        details: |
          Supported by the Post-doctorate research internship abroad (BEPE) of 
          FAPESP (São Paulo Research Funding Agency), I spent the year of 2022
          working as a visiting researcher at the NOIRLab institute, in Tucson,
          Arizona. During my time there, I worked on projects related to 
          metal-poor stars. In particular, we used photometric criteria to 
          select metal-poor stars in S-PLUS and studied them in greater details 
          using data from spectroscopic follow-ups using the telescopes Blanco, 
          Gemini and Magellan-Clay. This collaboration is still ongoing even
          now that I'm back in Brazil.

    title: Skills &amp; Proficiency
    intro: |
      A quick and not too serious guestimate of my proficience levels with 
      different tools. All levels are set relative to my percepted proficience 
      with python programming, which itself is very far from an absolute 100.
      
      The scale basically goes from "I built the python package that does the 
      photometric calibration for the S-PLUS survey" to "I almost always can 
      commit/push, and usually can clone, github repositories".
    toolset:
      - name: Python
        level: 99%

      - name: Topcat / Stilts
        level: 90%

      - name: Inkscape
        level: 80%

      - name: Blender
        level: 80%

      - name: LaTeX
        level: 60%

      - name: HTML5 & CSS
        level: 50%

      - name: Github
        level: 30%
